        <h3> My Pandemic Story </h3>
        <p>
          Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It 
          has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making 
          it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at 
          Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure 
          Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through 
          the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. 
          Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
          (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a 
          treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first 
          line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

          The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those 
          interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by 
          Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions 
          from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

        <h3>About My Business</h3>
        <p>
          In order to tell the story of how La Villa came to be in 1982 properly, 
          we must go back three decades before. In 1955 my Uncle, Gino Branchinelli 
          opened the family's first Pizzeria on 5th avenue and Bay ridge. He along 
          with my Other Uncle, Antonio opened more locations around Brooklyn and in 
          1960 opened Gino's Italian Ices on 39th street as well.  In the late 60's 
          My Father Benito joined my uncle at his current location in Long Beach, 
          Long Island which opened in 1962.  After 14 years there, my Father decided 
          to leave Long Beach. In the spring of 1982, along with other family members, 
          he opened the La Villa Located in the Lindenwood section of Howard Beach.  
          The Pizzeria was small with seating for only about 25-30 people, 
          but it was always standing room only!
