        <h2>La Villa Pizzeria</h2>
        <p class="business-info">
          In order to tell the story of how La Villa came to be in 1982 properly, 
          we must go back three decades before. In 1955 my Uncle, Gino Branchinelli 
          opened the family's first Pizzeria on 5th avenue and Bay ridge. He along 
          with my Other Uncle, Antonio opened more locations around Brooklyn and in 
          1960 opened Gino's Italian Ices on 39th street as well.  In the late 60's 
          My Father Benito joined my uncle at his current location in Long Beach, 
          Long Island which opened in 1962.  After 14 years there, my Father decided 
          to leave Long Beach. In the spring of 1982, along with other family members, 
          he opened the La Villa Located in the Lindenwood section of Howard Beach.  
          The Pizzeria was small with seating for only about 25-30 people, 
          but it was always standing room only!
