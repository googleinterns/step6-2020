          Hello! I'm John and I'm a singer. This pandemic is a rough one and
          I have personally also been affected by it. My global tour has been
          cancelled and I'm not sure when I can perform again. 

          Regardless, there are other people - like businesses in my local area
          (San Francisco) that are getting affected. Feel free to send me a email to
          chat or connect. 

          A little bit about me: I enjoy swimming and painting. Before the pandemic,
          I would head off to the nearby beach and take a swim. Painting is a little
          difficult for me, but I'm getting there!
