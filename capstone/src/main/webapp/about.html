                  Is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019. Many people has been affected, including local businesses.
                  Many businesses were forced to pause their business to help slow the spread of the pandemic.<br>

                  a jewelry boutique in Asheville, North Carolina that she first opened in 2015 after previously running a similar store 
                  in Chicago for roughly seven years.
                  As it stands, she believes she has enough money saved to “string it along for a couple of months,” she says.<br>

              Support Local Businesses is a platform that gives local businesses the opportunity to share their pandemic story,
              voice out their struggles, promote their business, and reach out to their local community for help. 
              The general people can use this platform to educate themselves with real stories from their local or gloabl businesses
              that are being impacted from COVID-19. There are several ways to help and build your local community digitally.

              As a team of three Google STEP interns, we decided to build this platform during the COVID-19 pandemic because we feel that this is what's helpful for 
              those local communities that are affected. You can read more about the pandemic and keep updated at the CDC website.
