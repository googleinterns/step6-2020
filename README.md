### Objective

This is our Google 2020 [STEP internship](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/step/) project. 
Support Local Businesses is a platform where businesses can share how the COVID-19 Pandemic affected 
them and reach out to the general public for assistance virtually. 

We build for the small businesses around the world that are being affected 
by the COVID-19 Pandemic. We know that this pandemic has affected numerous small businesses 
and we want to create a platform to support and unite communities during this difficult time.
